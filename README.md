# Contact Book Management System

A Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application to manage a contact book. This project demonstrates core Python programming concepts such as file handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), and modular design. The program supports adding, viewing, searching, and removing contacts while persisting data across sessions using a CSV file.
